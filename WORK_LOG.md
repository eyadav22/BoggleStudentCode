| January 6th  |  6:30 - 7:00pm  | Began by writing the original version of my Boggle solution using DFS combined with a TST to store the dictionary. I focused mainly on correctness at this stage, making sure I could successfully traverse the board, track visited cells, and identify valid words from the dictionary. To build words during recursion, I initially used string concatenation (prefix + c), which worked logically but I later realized was inefficient. At this point, my priority was getting a working solution rather than optimizing runtime or memory usage |
| January 7th  |  5:45 - 6:15pm  |                                              Continued developing and testing the initial solution. I used a HashSet to store valid words in order to prevent duplicates, since the same word could be found through multiple DFS paths. After testing and reviewing runtime behavior, I realized that although this approach passed most tests, it involved unnecessary overhead from repeated string creation and extra memory usage from the HashSet. This led me to start thinking about how I could refactor the solution to be more efficient. |
| January 9th  | 9:45 -10:25 pm  |                                Refactored my existing solution to improve efficiency. I replaced string concatenation with a StringBuilder, using append and delete operations to properly backtrack during DFS. I also removed the HashSet and switched to an ArrayList, instead preventing duplicates by marking isEndOfWord = false in the TST once a word is found. This allowed me to avoid extra data structures while still ensuring correctness. I carefully tested to ensure that no valid words were skipped and no duplicates were added. |
| January 11th | 11:15- 11:50 pm |                         Finalized and cleaned up the solution by improving the integration between DFS and the TST. I added a helper method (nextNode) to simplify character traversal within the TST and make the recursion easier to reason about. I verified bounds checking, visited logic, and adjacency traversal, then sorted the final output for consistent results. This final pass focused on readability, clarity of comments, and confirming that the optimized solution behaved the same as the original, but with better performance. |
